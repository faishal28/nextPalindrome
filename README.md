**Code Specification:**

The Solution is written in c++ 11.

Time Complexity = *O(N)*

where, N = no. of digits in the given number.

**Problem Statement:**

For a positive integer P of not more than 1000000 digits, write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than P to output. (Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.)

*Input*

The first argument is integer t which is the number of test cases. Followed by t number of positive integers.

*Output*

For each P, output the smallest palindrome larger than P.
